        '<p> It’s hard to believe that Easter is almost upon us. Like many families, you might be considering buying a rabbit to celebrate the season. If that is your intention, take a moment to reflect on the following information. According to pet adoption experts, buying a rabbit for Easter is a terrible idea.</p>' +
        '<p>“Rabbits aren’t pocket pets, they are not low maintenance or low cost. They are very social and interactive. They need daily environmental and social interaction just as a dog or a cat would,” Joyce Kuhns, lead education and adoption coordinator for Southeastern PA-DE House Rabbit Society told Delaware Online. </p>' +
        '<p>According to The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, thousands of bunnies purchased during the Easter season are released into the wild or brought to shelters and abandoned every year. It happens once the novelty of owning a bunny wears off.</p>' +
        '<p>Buying a bunny is not a short term project. They mature quickly and can live just as long as a small dog. Puberty hits hard at around 4 months so they might get aggressive and start biting. The American Rabbit Breeders Association also says that they might lose interest in cuddling when their hormones start raging.</p>' +
        '<p>Rabbits will also form a deep attachment to their owner and if they lose a playmate or a human in their family, they will mourn the loss.</p>' +
        '<p>Rabbit bones are rather brittle and fractures happen frequently. These fractures can be difficult to repair because their bones are tiny.</p>' +
        '<p>“A kid will want to pick up a rabbit and squeeze, but bunnies equate that to ‘I’m about to be eaten.’ They will struggle, the kid drops it, and bones can get broken,” said Kuhns.</p>' +
        '<p>BinkyBunny.com says that the ongoing cost for a single rabbit can be $80 per month, which is a surprise to most rabbit lovers. That is just for basic care and does not include vet bills for emergencies or illness. Spaying and neutering a bunny can run between $300 and $400. If you get a bunny from a rescue that has already been spayed or neutered it can help you avoid that cost.</p>' +
        '<p>Bunny-proofing the home is also something that most new rabbit owners overlook. It can be expensive to repair any damage from chewing, digging, and other issues. Rabbits naturally chew everything, so all cords, baseboards, and furniture legs will need to be protected.</p>' +
        '<p>Rabbits will need a constant source of grass, hay, and pellets (with 18% protein or higher). Fresh greens and vegetables also need to be supplied. Rabbits also need a proper litter box, sometimes in multiple areas of the house.</p>' +
        '<p>Many people will lose interest in the rabbit and abandon them in the wild, assuming that they will survive. In reality, a domesticated bunny does not have the same instincts as a wild bunny.</p>' +
        '<p>The ASPCA says you should provide your child with a book on rabbit care before you buy one. If they are begging you for a bunny, take them to a local shelter or rescue group, where you can talk to an expert about the possibility of actually adopting a rabbit.</p>'

        '<p>In Bogota, Colombia, an unusual event happened last November 7, 2019. Diana Lorena Alvarez, 27, placed her son, Samuel in his crib one early morning. She just went home and he was still asleep.</p>' +
        '<p>After some time, she discovered that her son, Samuel is no longer in the crib and was even able to crawl away from it. Wanting to know what really happened, she checked the CCTV recording and she couldn’t believe what she saw.</p>' +
        '<p>“I was a short distance from him when I suddenly noticed that he had woken up and had left the crib by himself, for this reason I wanted to go back over the recordings so that I could see how he got out of his crib,” she was quoted as saying. “It was at that moment that I discovered that the cat had saved his life.”</p>' +
        '<p>To her surprise, Diana found something else, something unexpected but absolutely wonderful because her son’s life was saved! She sure wasn’t ready for what the recording showed her.</p>' +
        '<p>Diana discovered the heroic act of their cat. In the CCTV video, it showed little Samuel slowly wriggling on their floor. He was able to escape his crib. As he was crawling on their floor, their grey Siamese cat was looking at the boy, as if knowing that the boy will be in danger.</p>' +
        '<p>The cat, whose name was Gatubela didn’t stop watching little Samuel. The cat was seen alert and as he slowly goes to the direction of the stairs, Gatubela immediately goes down from the chair.</p>' +
        '<p>Since they were on the second floor, Gatubela knew what will happen to their little Samuel if she didn’t react soon. She immediately jumps to the other chair and unto the first step of the stairs.</p>' +
        '<p>From there, she hugs and stops Samuel from going any further. She is then seen slightly pushing and guiding the infant back to change direction. Just a split second would have led to an accident.</p>' +
        '<p>Gatubela didn’t move from her place, she was still alert, still checking if the infant will try to go back near the stairs.</p>' +
        '<p>Gatubela was indeed a hero! This beautiful cat was alert and knew what she needed to do; seemingly how a mom cat takes care of their kittens if then wander off too far.</p>' +
        '<p>“If it had not been for the cat my son would have rolled down the stairs. Watching the footage, I felt really surprised and lucky,” Diana stated in the report.</p>' +
        '<p>Diana was relieved, shocked, and thankful with what she saw. If not for Gatubela, we can’t imagine what could have happened to little Samuel.</p>' +
        '<p>Diana then posted this amazing clip in a Facebook group called Fundación Gatos Bogotanos en Adopción last November 2, 2019.</p>' +
        '<p>Her post went viral and already has 7.9k reactions and 25k shares! Who wouldn’t want to share this beautiful story?</p>' +
        '<p>Don’t forget to watch and share the heroic act of this lovely cat.</p>'

        '<p>But since the coronavirus has grown into a global pandemic, Mac’s job responsibilities have shifted slightly. Now he’s been charged with finding a different kind of hot commodity, toilet paper, which has become suddenly scarce in this new era of panic buying!</p>' +
        '<p>The adorable video below shows the energetic pup racing around the police department in search of a hidden roll of toilet paper. The dog looks under a desk, to no avail, but then picks up the scent again near the filing cabinets. He frantically sniffs around, his entire body shaking with excitement, before correctly identifying the exact drawer containing the hidden roll. Then this very good boy sits down and patiently waits for his human officers to help retrieve the hidden stash.</p>' +
        '<p>“With all the silly panic buying. We enlisted the help of #PDMac to help find the essentials. Only buy what you need, think of others,” officers captioned this cute and hilarious video. The adorable (and timely clip) quickly garnered thousands of page views on Twitter.</p>' +
        '<p>It’s pretty clear from the video that Mac, whose basically wriggles with joy while his works, really, really loves his job. He’s also pretty good at it! It only took him a couple of seconds to find this coronavirus contraband. Did you even know toilet paper rolls had a scent? No, we didn’t either.</p>' +
        '<p>His human officers are probably pretty happy that Mac has learned this new trick, which will certainly come in handing when cruising empty supermarket aisles. Regardless, we hope Mac can go back to his real job soon, because that would mean that this scary pandemic is finally over! In the meantime, we’ve found this adorable video is a pretty great way to distract ourselves during self-isolation. Good boy, Mac! Keep up the good work!</p>'
